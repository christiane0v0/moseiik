The dockerfile present in this repo uses a base image called neginx which is compatable with both architectures:
x86_64 "amd64" and aarch64 "arm64".

Therefore, the installation of qemu wasn't necessary for the docker image. However, we needed to install some dependencies and also stup Rust.

In order to build and run the docker image on local machine for x86, we used the following lines:
$ sudo docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t mosaiic .
$ sudo docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it mosaiic

In order to build and run the docker image on local machine for aarch64, we used the following lines:
$ sudo docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t mosaiic_aarch64 .
$ sudo docker run --platform linux/arm64 -it mosaiic_aarch64

Images were first tested locally to get successful build, run and test pass before deploying in the CI chain.

There is a possibility to use -rm option when to get rid of image after running it but we haven't used it for our trials on our local machines.
